## V televizi notifier
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This short python script is meant to serve as an 'integrated' notifier of
## TV shows in Ubuntu with libnotify. It is using the capabilites of web
## application vtelevizi.cz and its short personal RSS channel.
##
## For RSS channel parsing, the script uses feedparser (http://feedparser.org).
##
##
## Dependencies
## ------------
## For correct usage, you have to have python-notify and python-feedparser
## packages installed. They are both available in standard repositories.
##
## Usage
## -----
## There are three configuration variables.
## - rss_base_link - link to your rss feed from vtelevizi.cz. You have to
##                   to include the token at the end of the URL.
## - timeshift_from_GMT - due to the feedparser time parsing method, we have to
##                        shift every showtime we recieve in correct timezone.
## - tell_m_n_minutes_before - how many minutes before the start of the show
##                             the notification should be displayed
##
## After configuration, the script runs in an infinite loop. Every minute, it
## checkes whether some show is starting in n minutes. If yes, it shows the
## notification. Every two minutes, RSS feed is checked again to include
## updates. Items are stored in local list, every time RSS is refreshed,
## the list is deleted. Every time a notification is shown, the show is deleted
## from the list.
